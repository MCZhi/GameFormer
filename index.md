## Abstract

Autonomous vehicles operating in complex real-world environments require accurate predictions of interactive behaviors between traffic participants. While existing works focus on modeling agent interactions based on their past trajectories, their future interactions are often ignored. This paper addresses the interaction prediction problem by formulating it with hierarchical game theory and proposing the GameFormer framework to implement it. Specifically, we present a novel Transformer decoder structure that uses the prediction results from the previous level together with the common environment background to iteratively refine the interaction process. Moreover, we propose a learning process that regulates an agent's behavior at the current level to respond to other agents' behaviors from the last level. Through experiments on a large-scale real-world driving dataset, we demonstrate that our model can achieve state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on the interaction prediction task. We also validate the model's capability to jointly reason about the ego agent's motion plans and other agents' behaviors in both open-loop and closed-loop planning tests, outperforming a variety of baseline methods.

## Method Overview
The proposed framework draws inspiration from the hierarchical game-theoretic modeling of agent interactions. The framework encodes the historical states of agents and maps as background information. A level-0 agent's future trajectories are decoded independently, based on the initial modality query. At level-k, an agent responds to all other level-(k-1) agents. Scene context encoding is obtained via a Transformer-based encoder. The level-0 decoder takes the modality embedding and agent history encodings as query and outputs level-0 future trajectories and scores. The level-k decoder incorporates a self-attention module to model the level-(k-1) future interactions and appends this information to the scene context encoding.

## Interaction Prediction
Given agents' tracks for the past 1 second on a corresponding map, predict the joint future positions of 2 interacting agents for 8 seconds into the future.

## Closed-loop planning testing
The planner outputs a planned trajectory at each time step, which is used to simulate the vehicleâ€™s state at the next time step. The other agents are replayed from a log according to their observed states in open-loop.
